Most of the site is themed using Tailwind's [typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin). You can view the configuration in `tailwind.config.cjs`. As mentioned at the beginning of this post, the overall theme is taken from [Tailwind's "Spotlight"](https://spotlight.tailwindui.com/).

If you wish to change the theme of your code blocks, you can edit the `src/prism.css` file. Prism themes can be [found here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/tree/master/themes).

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
	return 'Hello World';
}
```
